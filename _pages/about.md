I’m a Computer Science graduate based in Athens, Greece, with professional experience in both web application development and ICT support. My background allows me to approach projects not only from a development perspective, but also with a strong understanding of system reliability, user needs, and technical troubleshooting.
From designing clean, responsive user interfaces to implementing backend functionality and deploying live applications, I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle. I’ve collaborated with small businesses, individual clients, and internal teams—translating ideas and requirements into functional, maintainable web solutions.
Alongside development, I currently work as an ICT Help Desk Agent in New York College of Athens, where I fix the hardware and software issues, and build small internal tools that improve communication and workflow. This role has strengthened my ability to work under pressure, explain technical concepts clearly, and adapt quickly to new technologies.
